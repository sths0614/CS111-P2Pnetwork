# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
I used forking to make my peer download and upload files in parallel. 
The waitpid function was also used to ensure synchronization. 

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
1. Popular tracker bug
When running "make run-popular", the message of "tracker connection closed prematurely" comes up. It is because the tasks' buffer size is too small, 
the abundance of peers will overflow it. Therefore, by statically changing the TASKBUFSIZ, the error message goes away. 

2. Checking for existence files and diretories
We checked if the files and directories the peer is asking for exist. If not, then return an error message saying invalid file/directory

3. Checking for location of file (current directory or not)
We checked if the file peer asked for is in the current directory. If not, then return an error message saying access not granted. 

4. 




# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
